	<h4>context</h4>
	<p>While George Washington is one of the most recognizable names in American history, his legend incorporates some fiction along with fact. To Americans today, Washington is widely known as the first president, as well as the man whose face graces the one-dollar bill and the quarter coin. These facts are easily corroborated by wallets and purses everywhere, but some legends are not as easily verifiable.

		One of the most popular legends associated with Washington is how he supposedly chopped down a cherry tree and then couldn't tell a lie. While Washington may have chopped down cherry trees in his Virginia plantation, it is unlikely that the extraction of a single tree carried with it enough importance to motivate a significant life change in Washington's life. What the legend of the tree symbolizes, however, is Washington's accidental, haphazard rise from colonial citizen to army general to national president. Indeed, Washington, one of the earliest American heroes, was, in his mind, a reluctant and unlikely one.</p>
